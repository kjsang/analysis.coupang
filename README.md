In order to understand the changing political and economic context under capitalism in advanced countries, it is important to identify `political alliances` and `institutions` that support them. The emergence of platform giants in Korea is causing changes in the political landscape, as well as economic systems, and furthermore, the events and incidents created by platform companies are expanding into discussions on the relevance of related regulations. We want to analyze how Coupang, one of the domestic platform companies, responded to `regulations` in the process of establishing itself in the domestic environment and find out how the regulatory policies surrounding them have changed. To this end, we utilize an analysis technique called `text mining`.
